### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Miguel, a web developer and formerly a physicist with a PhD on quantum mechanics. I work as backend developer but I also feel comfortable wearing different hats as I
often do lots of frontend too.

My personal drives for getting into software development are:
- ðŸ”¨ **Build** cool products that users will enjoy and find useful.
- ðŸ“š **Learn** as much as possible, be it a new technology or improving my managing/leadership skills.
- ðŸ˜Š **Have fun** during the process. For me software development is probably one the most fun craftmanships in the modern world

This are some of the technologies/languages I work with:
